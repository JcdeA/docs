# Installing Vignette using AUR

If you prefer to install Vignette on Linux,  we provide the official [`vignette-git`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/vignette-git/) AUR package. For this guide, we will be using `yay`.



## Installation process

In order to install Vignette using yay, run the following command:


`yay vignette-git`



If more than one package appears you should find the right package, which should be listed as `aur/vignette-git`. In this example, that package is number `1`.

![](/img/install/yay-terminal-window.webp)



:::note 

When prompted for your password for sudo, enter it to proceed with the installation.

## Welcome to Vignette!

Don't forget to visit the [UI Overview](/client/overview.md) once your installation has completed. Alternatively, you can use the sidebar to get familiar with the interface of the application.

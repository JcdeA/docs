# Installing Vignette using AUR

If you wish to install Vignette on your Arch Linux computer, you may use any AUR helper of you choice. The package is [`vignette-git`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/vignette-git/). In the example below, I will be using yay.



## Installation process

In order to install Vignette using yay, please run the following command: 

`yay -S vignette-git`



If more than one package appears you should find the right package, which should be listed as `aur/vignette-git`. In this example, that package is number `1`.

:::note 

You may be required to type your password into the terminal when prompted.

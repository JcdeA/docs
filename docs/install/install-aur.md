# Installing Vignette using AUR

If you wish to install Vignette on your Linux computer, you can use any AUR helper of your choice.

The package is [`vignette-git`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/vignette-git/).

Here I'll be using `yay`.



## Installation process

In order to install Vignette using yay, run the following command:


`yay vignette-git`



If more than one package appears you should find the right package, which should be listed as `aur/vignette-git`. In this example, that package is number `1`.

![](/img/install/yay-terminal-window.webp)



:::note 

You may be required to type your password into the terminal when prompted.

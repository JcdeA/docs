# Installing Vignette Portable Binaries

If you do not prefer to install Vignette on your system and would like a "portable" binary, Vignette also provides such binaries.
These binaries have been tested to work on major platforms as much as the installable ones, and should not require any dependencies
aside from the aforementioned prerequisites.

## Windows

We provide Windows releases in our [GitHub](https://github.com/vignetteapp/vignette/releases/latest) as ZIP files. Find the ZIP for the respective platform
and download it. Below is an image of the Assets section of a previous release:

Extract the ZIP to your desired location and run `Vignette.exe`. The client should launch without any issues.

## Linux

Linux releases are also provided but in two forms: AppImage (coming soon) and the same ZIP file format for Windows. While the ZIP file is provided, we highly
recommend the AppImage variant as soon as it is available.

### ZIP

Linux releases are also provided alongside our Windows ZIP releases. Using the same link, download the ZIP like the original Windows ZIP and extract it on your desired
directory.

:::note
Should the executable fail to load for the first time, you may have to mark `Vignette` as executable; You can do this by right clicking into the file in your file manager, and
check **"Mark as executable"**. Alternatively, use **`chmod +x Vignette`** in the terminal.
:::

Once everything has been extracted, run `Vignette`.
